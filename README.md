Personal Portfolio WebPage

This webpage is a way for me to portray and organize the pojects I have done. It also allows me to send my website to companies as a sort of another form of my resume.

This web page is mainly a frontend focused project, so it was only built with HTML, CSS, JavScript, and Bootstrap.
